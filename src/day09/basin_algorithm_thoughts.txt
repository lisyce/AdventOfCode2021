start at upper left and traverse that way

go until we find a low point. every basin has a low point. (but move on if it's -1)

As you're stepping around, if you count a point, set it to -1. don't count a value again if it's -1.
^ or set it to 9

make a little roomba that sweeps up each basin ;aslkdf;aslksdjjf;lasksdkjff
roomba can only move horizontally and vertically
can we treat it so that it always keeps the edge of the board or a 9 on its right? it'd have to move and turn
this is like trying to do photoshop's magic wand then paint bucket operation

roomba has list of children and prompts them all to hatch one by one upon death
finish one generation then start the next

there is a watcher that controls roomba reproduction and pruning unnecessary roomba eggs
all roombas share the same memory (static)
---------------------------------------------
or
more simply
---------------------------------------------

start in the low point. fill it in. then just fill in 4 adjacent spots with that aren't a wall. store those locations

then do the next generation but only add the point to the list if it's not already in there

the basin is full when a whole generation has nowhere to lay egg-
