How should we store these snailfish numbers?
- String (PROB BEST)
- Custom class that contains a pair parameter which is of the same custom class. Could go on forever if you wanted to.

Algorithm for explosion:
[[[[4,3],4],4],[7,[[8,4],9]]] + [1,1] =
[[[[[4,3],4],4],[7,[[8,4],9]]],[1,1]]

TEMPLATE THE SNAILFISH NUMBER: IF YOU'VE GOT A 15 IN THERE OR WHATEVER, IT MESSES WITH INDEXES
FOR EXAMPLE: [[[[[X,X],X],X],[X,[[X,X],X]]],[X,X]]


1. find the leftmost pair of actual nums
2. if it's nested inside 4 pairs, you can explode it
3. if not, keep going right until you find an actual pair

We've found a pair: [4, 3]
- store those 2 values and their indexes
- go left until you find a regular num. if you find one, add the left value to it.
- do the same with the right number
- replace the entired exploded pair with "0"

Algorithm for splitting:
